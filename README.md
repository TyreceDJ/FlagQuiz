# FlagQuiz

Randomly generated quiz using APIs. 

Additionally, if an API contains images and names the quiz can be simulated this can be done in gamePlayer.js by giving the constructGame function the API data and accessors functions to the API's name and image properties.

The website is deployed at tyrecedj.github.io/FlagQuiz

I have future plans of expanding the variety of quiz games and adding two-player versus.
